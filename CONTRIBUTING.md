First of all, I would like to give you a thumbs up üëçüèª for choosing to contribute to the open source community. Also, thank you very much for choosing to participate in the VisActor community and contribute to this open source project.

## VChart Contribution Guide

The VisActor team usually develops and maintains issues on GitHub. Please open the [GitHub website](https://github.com/), click the `Sign up `button in the upper right corner, register your own account, and take the first step in your open source journey.

If you cannot open the Github site due to special circumstances, please inform us and proceed with project development through [Gitee](https://gitee.com/VisActor/VChart).

In the [VChart repository](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart), we have a [guide ](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)for all open source contributors on versioning, branching, and more. **Please take a few minutes to read about it** .

## Your first PullRequest

### Step 0: Install Git

Git is a version control system used to track and manage code changes in software development projects. It helps developers record and manage the history of code, facilitating team collaboration, code version control, merging code, and other operations. With Git, you can track each version of each file and easily switch and compare between different versions. Git also provides branch management functionality, allowing for multiple parallel development tasks to be performed simultaneously.

- Visit the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- Download the latest version of the Git installer.
- Run the downloaded installation program and follow the prompts of the installation wizard to install.
- After the installation is complete, you can use the Command Line command `git version `to confirm the installation is successful.

### Step 1: Fork the project

- First, you need to fork this project, enter the [VChart project page](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart), and click the Fork button in the upper right corner

![](https://lf9-dp-fe-cms-tos.byteorg.com/obj/bit-cloud/VChart/contribution-guide/fork.PNG)

- The project Your_Github_Username/vchart will appear in your GitHub account
- Use the following command on your local computer: Get a VChart folder

```
// ssh
git clone git@github.com:Your_Github_Username/VChart.git
// https
git clone https://github.com/Your_Github_Username/VChart.git
```

### Step 2: Get the project code

- Go to the VChart folder and add the remote address of the VChart

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/VisActor/VChart.git
```

- Get the latest source code of VChart

```
git pull upstream develop
```

### Step 3: Create a branch

- Okay, now we can start contributing our code. The default branch of VChart is the develop branch. Whether it's feature development, bug fixing, or documentation writing, please create a new branch and merge it into the develop branch. Use the following code to create a branch:

```
// Create a feature development branch
git checkout -b feat/xxxx

// Create a issue-fix development branch
git checkout -b fix/xxxx

// Create documentation and demo branches
git checkout -b docs/add-funnel-demo
```

Suppose we create a document modification branch `docs/add-fund-demo`

- Now we can change the code on the branch

- Assuming we have added some code and submitted it to the codebase

- Git commit -a -m "docs: add custom funnel demo and related docs". The commit information of VisActor follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)specification

  - `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
  - The commonly used `types `include docs (document, log modification), feat (new feature), fix (problem repair), refactor (Code Refactoring), etc. Please choose according to the actual situation.
  - Please write a brief and accurate description in English.
  - Before submitting the commit, we will perform a commit lint check, you can check the [rules](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart/blob/98711490e90532d896dd9e44dd00a3af5b95f06d/common/autoinstallers/lint/commitlint.config.js)

### Step 4: Merge and modify

- A common issue is that remote upstream (@visactor/vchart) has new updates, which can cause conflicts when we submit Pull Requests. Therefore, we can merge the commits of other remote developers with ours before submitting. Use the following code to switch to the develop branch.

```
git checkout develop
```

- Use the following code to pull out the latest remote code:

```
git pull upstream develop
```

- Switch back to your own development branch.

```
git checkout docs/add-funnel-demo
```

- Merge the develop commit into your own branch.

```
git rebase develop
```

- Submit the updated code to your own branch.

```
git push origin docs/add-funnel-demo
```

### Step 5: Submit Pull Request

You can click the `Compare & Pull Request `button on your GitHub repository page.

## FAQ

### node-canvas installation failure

VChart is a monorepo project, and when running VChart on the node side, we rely on the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) library. Therefore, when executing `rush update`, the `node-canvas` package needs to be installed. However, this package may fail to install on different operating systems. You can refer to the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) readme for installation dependencies. The installation methods for various operating systems are as follows:
